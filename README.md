# VTDML - Vr0umVr0um's Travel Down to Memory Lane

## DESCRIPTION
“VTDML” is the final project of my first year of computer science.

It's a blog-like website connected to a database and which is responsive.

It is divided into 5 parts: blog, characters, entertainment, contact, account.

This project also manages the administrator interface in addition to the classic user interface.

4. Add the VTDML directory into "~\XAMPP\htdocs".
5. Now you can access the project through "http://localhost/VTDML/blog.php".
